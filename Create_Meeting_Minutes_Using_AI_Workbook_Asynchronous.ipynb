The Affordable Learning Georgia website was shared as a hub for grantees to access resources including open educational resources, grant procedures, reporting deadlines, and grantee listserv. The two main repositories for OER created from the grants were discussed, and the features of the new Manifold platform were shared. Training resources were also highlighted.\",\n",
              " 'can turn on their cameras.\\n\\nThis meeting was about introducing the new ALG website, which will have a mega menu with sections on grants, resources, and news, as well as a data page. The website will also link to the Galileo Open Learning Materials repository, which contains old OER, and the Manifold repository, which is more interactive. The ALG Tracking Spreadsheet was also discussed, which is used to track data on grants such as the total award, the project lead, the course name and number, and the student savings. Lastly, the sustainability survey was mentioned, which is used to check in and make sure the work of the grant projects is still ongoing.',\n",

And we're hoping to have that ready for the fall of 2021. Great. Thank you so much.\\n\\nThis meeting was a discussion among the project teams of ALG (Athens Learning Group) which is a program that has been running since 2014. Each team discussed their project which involves transforming a textbook to an open stacks textbook and creating activities and simulations to engage students. The teams are from the University of West Georgia, Clayton State, University of North Georgia, and Georgia Gwinnett College. The projects are for Spanish, microbiology, introductory physics, and anthropology courses respectively. All of the projects are expected to be completed by the fall of 2021.\",\n",

We're also trying to hire a couple of students to help us write vignettes and case studies and give us feedback on how engaging these chapters are. Our timeline is similar to everyone else's and we'll let you know how the engaging students goes.\\n\\nThis is a meeting transcript from a group of 8 people from various universities who have received a grant to transform and introduction to anthropology textbook, create engaging contemporary examples of traditional anthropology concepts, create new custom lab manuals for an introductory biology sequence, transform textbooks and lab materials for two courses on autonomous vehicle sensors and PLC programmable logic controllers, move from a custom published text to proprietary materials for English 1101 and 1102, and create a math primer, videos, and online resources to improve understanding and retention in engineering courses. They are all working to create materials that are up to date, suitable for their students, and cost-saving for them. They plan to have the materials live by fall and will update the group on their progress.\",\n",

And we are going to develop a series of videos and online resources to help the students get up to speed on the topics that are covered in the course. We have seen in the past that a lot of students drop the course or fail because they don't have the prerequisite knowledge required for the course. So our goal is to create a math primer that will help the students get up to speed on the material and make it easier for them to understand the concepts. We have already done this for one or two semesters, but the feedback we have gotten is that the material is still too difficult for some of the students. This is understandable since some of them have failed calculus multiple times. We are going to keep on making the videos and trying to make the material accessible to students on different levels. We are also going to contact Amy Battles, as it seems she is working on something for physics, to see if we can share materials.\\n\\nThis project is focused on creating a math primer for a senior level fluid mechanics course at Kennesaw State University in order to help students get up to speed on the material and make it easier for them to understand the concepts. The team consists of 5 faculty members, a library and a graduate student assistant. The goal is to create a series of videos and online resources to help the students get up to speed on the topics covered in the course, as many students have dropped the course or failed due to not having enough prerequisites.

Five faculty members and a library are part of the team, and a graduate student assistant will also be recruited. The project involves writing a new textbook with open source materials and their own new materials, as well as creating instructor solutions and interactive components. The timeline for the project is one year. The meeting then moved on to discussing grant procedures and paperwork, such as service level agreements, invoices, and reports.

It also covers the role of the business office, the purchase order number, and the need for the invoice to come from the institution rather than the individual. Finally, it covers the semester status report, which is a Google form with information on the team members, the project's progress, and any questions they may have.\",\n",

The deadlines are December 19th, May 15th, August 14th, and December 18th. Additionally, a final report is due at the end of the final semester of the project, which is Fall 2023. The final report form is available on the Grants Information Center page, which will also be included in a follow up email with the kickoff recording. Transformations grants have a few extra questions on the form, so a Word document version of the narrative is recommended. Photos are optional, but if taken, should include the entire team. Second invoices should be sent to Dina Anderson at dina.anderson@usg.edu. Any questions or personal inquiries should be sent directly to Jeff Gallant at jeff.gallant@usg.edu. Finally, the ALGGRANTEES listserv is available for all grantees, and any publishing opportunities will be shared with them.',\n",
